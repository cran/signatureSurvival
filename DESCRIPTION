Description: When multiple Cox proportional hazard models are performed on clinical data 
    (month or year and status) and a set of differential expressions of genes, 
    the results (Hazard risks, z-scores and p-values) can be used to create gene-expression signatures. 
    Weights are calculated using the survival p-values of genes and are utilized to calculate expression 
    values of the signature across the selected genes in all patients in a cohort. A Single or multiple 
    univariate or multivariate Cox proportional hazard survival analyses of the patients in one cohort 
    can be performed by using the gene-expression signature and visualized using our survival plots.
